h1. Frog

Frog will be a full-featured blog application written using the sinatra web framework.  It's still in early development.

h2. Installing and Running

* gem install sinatra        # the tiny web framework
* gem install active_record  # my orm of choice
* gem install sqlite3-ruby   # the default data store
* gem install RedCloth       # textile markup processor
* gem install syntaxi        # code syntax formatting

* git clone git://github.com/moomerman/frog.git
* cd frog
* rake frog:init
* ./frog.rb
# go to http://localhost:4567/

By default frog uses sqlite3 as the data store, but you can use anything that ActiveRecord supports, configure this in lib/models.rb.

To create a new blog entry you need to go to /admin and login with admin:admin.
